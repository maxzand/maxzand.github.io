title: Distilling Symbols from Perceptual World Models
summary: "The purpose of this project is to distill symbols out of the latent vectors learned by the Dreamer family of models. One approach utilizes a sparse autoencoder of the latent vectors, creating a binary vector potentially mapping to internal concepts. Then, we analyze the degree to which this binary vector maps to real concepts from ground-truth data, for instance via mutual information. This is compared to the default dense state vector. Furthermore, mutual information can be converted into a regularization objective itself, as in InfoGAN. Using this analysis as a basis, we propose and study further architectural changes to the model, and methods for recovering human symbols. Led by Lucas Saldyt."
