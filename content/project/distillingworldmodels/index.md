title: Distilling Symbols from Perceptual World Models
summary: "This project distills symbols from the latent vectors learned by Dreamer models. Using a sparse autoencoder, we create binary vectors that potentially map to internal concepts and analyze their alignment with real-world concepts via mutual information. We also explore regularization objectives, inspired by InfoGAN, and propose architectural changes to enhance symbol recovery."
