title: Reinforcement Learning Balance of Inverted Spherical Pendulum on Holonomic Drive
summary: "Developed a simulation of an inverted spherical pendulum on a holonomic-driven robot using Gymnasium and MuJoCo. I independently modeled both the system simulation and reward function, achieving realistic and responsive control for this complex environment. The model was trained using Soft Actor-Critic"
