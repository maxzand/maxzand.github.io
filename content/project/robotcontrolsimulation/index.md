title: Robotic Manipulator Simulation App
summary: "The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly GUI in MATLAB that simulates the force control and dynamics of a robotic arm from the input of DH parameters, masses, gear ratios, etc.  The following two assumptions will be made in all following calculations: all the joints are either revolute or prismatic and all the links are straight."
